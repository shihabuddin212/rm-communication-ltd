        content: [
            "In today's demanding digital ecosystem, an internet service provider (ISP) must deliver more than just megabits per second. True quality lies in the combination of reliable speed, ironclad security, transparent rules, and compliance with national guidelines. RM Communication Ltd. stands out as a leading telecom provider in Dhaka, offering an ecosystem that beautifully aligns state-of-the-art services with BTRC regulatory standards.",
            "Let's talk about performance first. RM Communication delivers pure, unshared optical fiber connections straight to your router. Our retail packages—ranging from Silver+ (50 Mbps for 890 TK/month) to Sky+ (300 Mbps for 4,200 TK/month)—are priced according to official BTRC tariff guidelines, ensuring no arbitrary price hikes. Higher-tier options like the Sapphire+ (200 Mbps) or Star+ (250 Mbps) include premium dual-band Wi-Fi routers for free, optimizing your indoor spatial coverage and eliminating lagging. For business clients, our Dedicated Internet Access (DIA) provides a 1:1 contention ratio with customized firewall policies to ensure smooth corporate transitions.",
            "Transparency is another cornerstone of our service, detailed clearly within our Terms and Conditions. To maintain network integrity and prevent cyber security liabilities, we enforce a strict policy against connection reselling and third-party sharing. This keeps our fiber nodes clean, ensures each home gets 100% of their allocated bandwidth, and aligns with subscriber identification protocols. All hardware provided remains company property, backed by standard SLAs to guarantee immediate troubleshooting or replacement if hardware issues arise.",
            "Furthermore, our Privacy Policy is fully optimized to align with the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act 2006 (Amended) and the Cyber Security Act of Bangladesh. By employing secured databases, firewall interceptions, and strictly authorized staff access, we guarantee your personal credentials and browsing security are protected at all times. While we cooperate transparently with official law enforcement warrants under BTRC regulations, we never share, lease, or sell your subscriber details to advertising networks or third-party brokers.",
            "When you choose RM Communication Ltd., you are investing in a licensed, lawful, and lightning-fast digital backbone. From our 24/7 dedicated support staff to our seamless online client billing portals, every component of RM is engineered to give you complete peace of mind.

This is where RM Communication Ltd.'s Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) network excels.",
            "Unlike traditional broadband providers that use low-cost copper coaxial cables that degrade speed, RM Communication uses pure glass fiber optic cabling directly into your residence. This technology supports symmetric speeds, meaning your upload speed is just as fast as your download speed. Whether you are sending massive assets for work or streaming live gaming streams on YouTube, you experience zero throttling.",
            "Our most popular package, Platinum+ (100 Mbps for 1,260 TK/month), represents the ideal sweet spot for modern smart homes. It offers ample overhead so that multiple devices can stream 4K content, run corporate VPNs, and download large files concurrently without any latency spikes. All retail packages, starting from Silver+ (50 Mbps) up to Sky+ (300 Mbps), receive unthrottled fiber optical pipes directly from our main switches, backed by automatic redundancy routings.",
            "Choosing RM Communication means joining a network engineered for the future. We provide free installation, premium optical network terminals (ONUs), and 24/7 dedicated support staff, making it the most sensible, high-value decision for your household digital needs."

For SMEs and corporate offices, RM Communication Ltd. offers Dedicated Internet Access (DIA). Our Dedicated Internet provides a direct, unshared point-to-point link with a 1:1 contention ratio. This guarantees you get 100% of the purchased bandwidth at all times, with zero drops.",

Before requesting a technician visit, it is critical to understand that Wi-Fi signal strength is heavily influenced by physical layout barriers.",
            "Wi-Fi routers transmit data using radio frequencies, which degrade when passing through brick walls, structural concrete pillars, glass partitions, and metal mirrors. To solve this, always place your router in a high, central location of your flat rather than hidden inside cupboards or low on the floor. Keeping it away from electric ovens, cordless phones, and smart appliances also prevents signal crosstalk.",
            "Another common problem is channel noise. In dense Dhaka neighborhoods, dozens of Wi-Fi routers operate on matching frequencies. Our customer support recommends switching older routers to the 5GHz frequency band, which offers significantly wider channels and less interference compared to the crowded 2.4GHz band. Higher packages, like Sapphire+ (200 Mbps) and Star+ (250 Mbps), include dual-band Wi-Fi routers for free to automatically manage this traffic.",
